# The final data story

[Final Project On Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/rethinking-birth-rate-crisis/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II

**Theme** 

I changed my shorthand theme from a complex colored theme to a more text-based theme with images and data vis. I made this change because I was thinking from my target audience perspective, that if I was a policymaker who is reading this website, I would prefer to read a more professional style that is similar to policy memos that I read on a regular basis, instead of having to roll through a lot of animation to get to the topic. However, to keep it entertaining, I added a lot of images and some anecdotes. 

**Image**

I reviewed the library guidance on how to properly cite images and improved my in text citations. 

**Emphasis**

In part II, I had a stronger emphasis of on historical policies in Korea that have failed. I planned to do a scroll-through animation on year introduced, content, and the outcome. However, after reevaluating my target audiences, I decided to quickly lay out significant past policies on one page. 

**Color**

I kept the major text color as white for simplicity and minimalism but changed highlight colors into orange. I had green in part II, representing new life and new journey, however, I think the color is too bright and can be difficult to read. I changed it into the color orange, which is matching my title page image. I also modified my data viz into the orange color scheme. 

## The audience

I identified  policymakers in the field of reproductive rights worldwide as my audience, with attempt to showcase how certain policies beyond financial objectives could increase birthrate as many policymakers are urging to achieve. I narrowed my focus on policymakers by underlying assumption of professional knowledge, including the current landscape of dropping birth rate, why it is dangerous (I did briefly described this for others who might read this), and public spending and investment knowledge. For Korean policymakers specifically, I included agencies on the call to action section that they could potentially work with, lobby with, and reach out to. 

I narrowed the focus of my project by giving specific country policy comparisons between South Korea and Sweden. I personally find these countries representitive of some of their neighboring countries or cultures. For example, the crisis that Korea is facing is highly relatable in China and Japan as well, and Swedish policies are somewhat similar to what has been implemented in EU. Thus, by approaching to very specific examples, I hope to appeal to broader audiences. 

This subject is inspired by my undergraduate political science professor, who is a Korean immigrant. I have heard stories about the growing feminism in the country, which gave me incentive to research into gender norm barriers and solutions regarding the choice of having children.

# Final thoughts

I plan to revisit my page and further develop it after this course. I had no experience with Tableau and have tried multiple times to generate data vis but it took too long. I hope to generate interractive data table with Tableau and export to my shorthand project in the future. 

I also think I would revisit the data sites and tools that were introduced during this class, they were incredibly helpful.
