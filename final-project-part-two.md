# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience would include three groups. 

1. Korean officials that are stakeholders in the policymaking of reproductive rights and fertility rate goals. In 2023, the Republic of Korea established a **Presidential Committee on Aging Society and Population Policy** dedicated to addressing the aging crisis and Koreaâ€™s total fertility rate that is hitting a low record. This committee, along with **South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare**, would be my primary target audience.

2. I target to provide information and advice to **global policymakers** who are looking to address population aging, create a more friendly environment for child raising, and/or improve fertility rate. This would include policymakers from **China**, **Japan**, **Italy**, etc.

3. This project could also inspire **private business**'s initiatives to provide a more collaborative and flexible work environment for young parents, and consider what businesses could offer to address aging society while remaining profit and productivity. Companies with leading influence and status could be a key influencer in their industries in making these policies, such as **Samsung**, **Starbucks**, and **BCG**.  

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|**Reasonable and Appealing Logics of the Story**| 1. Do you find the logical flow smooth? If not, where would you change?|
|**General Understanding of Content**|2. What do you think is the major purpose of the project? 3. What questions do you have after viewing the project?|
|**Clear Visualization**|4. What data appeal to you the most? 5. What other elements or sections could be added to assist your understanding or visualization?|


## Interview findings

| Questions               | Danning (MSPPM year I) | Sushruti (Master of Urban Design) |  
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| 1|The set up is nice and the hook is interesting. Might lose audience while explaining policies, can combine that with more data charts. |Would be helpful to address why birth rate is important, thinking economic perspective might help the logic.|             
| 2|Why women do not want kids in SK? What are the major factors?|Are there any factors from education that add pressure to having children?|             
| 3|The data chart with declining birthrate; maybe adding a line for world average would help. It provides an overall picture of the situation.|Consider refining Sweden over time vs. Korea over time. Might get rid of the historical section since it might get wordy.|
