# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience would include three groups. 

1. Korean officials that are stakeholders in the policymaking of reproductive rights and fertility rate goals. In 2023, the Republic of Korea established a **Presidential Committee on Aging Society and Population Policy** dedicated to addressing the aging crisis and Korea’s total fertility rate that is hitting a low record. This committee, along with **South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare**, would be my primary target audience.

2. I target to provide information and advice to **global policymakers** who are looking to address population aging, create a more friendly environment for child raising, and/or improve fertility rate. This would include policymakers from **China**, **Japan**, **Italy**, etc.

3. This project could also inspire **private business**'s initiatives to provide a more collaborative and flexible work environment for young parents, and consider what businesses could offer to address aging society while remaining profit and productivity. Companies with leading influence and status could be a key influencer in their industries in making these policies, such as **Samsung**, **Starbucks**, and **BCG**.  

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|**Reasonable and Appealing Logics of the Story**|1. Do you find the logical flow smooth? If not, where would you change?|
|**General Understanding of Content**|2. What do you think is the major purpose of the project? 3. What questions do you have after viewing the project?|
|**Clear Visualization**|4. What data appeal to you the most? 5. What other elements or sections could be added to assist your understanding or visualization?|


## Interview findings

| Questions               | MSPPM year I Student | Master of Urban Design Student |  
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| 1|The set up is nice and the hook is interesting. Might lose audience while explaining policies, can combine that with more data charts. |Would be helpful to address why birth rate is important, thinking economic perspective might help the logic.|             
| 2|Why women do not want kids in SK? What are the major factors?|Are there any factors from education that add pressure to having children?|             
| 3|The data chart with declining birthrate; maybe adding a line for world average would help. It provides an overall picture of the situation.|Consider refining Sweden over time vs. Korea over time. Highlight that Sweden's successful policy with data results. Consider getting rid of the historical section since it might get wordy.|             


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis (Findings/Observations from Interviews) | Anticipated changes for Part III |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Balanced Structure | Less emphasis on the historical part that might already be known by readers, such as why some policies failed. However, factors that impacted the low birth rate might be helpful to get the logic straight. |
| Visualization | More comparisons in singular charts to showcase Korean data compared to world average. |
| Concise Swedish Elements | Instead of making full set of comparisons, focus on what factors led to the Swedish policy success, and how could Korea adapt that. |
| Pictures | More pictures, instead of all data charts, might help readers focus for a longer time. |
