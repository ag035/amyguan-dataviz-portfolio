# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience would include three groups. 

1. Korean officials that are stakeholders in the policymaking of reproductive rights and fertility rate goals. In 2023, the Republic of Korea established a **Presidential Committee on Aging Society and Population Policy** dedicated to addressing the aging crisis and Koreaâ€™s total fertility rate that is hitting a low record. This committee, along with **South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare**, would be my primary target audience.

2. I target to provide information and advice to **global policymakers** who are looking to address population aging, create a more friendly environment for child raising, and/or improve fertility rate. This would include policymakers from **China**, **Japan**, **Italy**, etc.

3. This project could also inspire **private business**'s initiatives to provide a more collaborative and flexible work environment for young parents, and consider what businesses could offer to address aging society while remaining profit and productivity. Companies with leading influence and status could be a key influencer in their industries in making these policies, such as **Samsung**, **Starbucks**, and **BCG**.  

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

Do you find the logical flow smooth? 
-> set up looks nice, the hook is good; might lose people when starts introducing policies (impact)
-> address why it's important (how economies would improve with that) 

What do you think is the major point of the presentation? 

What data appeals to you the most? 
-> chart with birth rate (maybe add a line for average); provides the picture of the situation 
-> refine sweden over time vs south korea over time 

What questions do you have after viewing the presentation? 
-> why women does not want to have kid 
-> any factors from education 

What other elements or sections could be added to assist your understanding or visualization?
-> easy to understand 
-> historical section might get wordy 

-> factors with Sweden that makes it successful (give final index as data and start from there)
